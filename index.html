<p> 10/20/22 For the past week we have been working on a bottle rocket. We thought of using a baloon but it would not expand in the bottle due to air-pressure<p>

<p> 10/21/22 We finally launched our bottle rocket and it did not go as expected. We loaded it with baking soda and vinegar adn when it launched it spun horizontly which caused vinger to spray everyone nearby, luckily Abdul and I watched from a distance so we were not sprayed by vinegar. The rocket did not go very high but it stayed in the air for around 5-6 seconds. <p>
