<p> 9/6/22 For the past week we have been making a rube goldberg machine for a project</p>

<p> 9/7/22 We have started making a rube goldberg with groups<br>
<p> 9/16/22 Forthe past week we have been making a rube goldberg as a team and for challenge day we made a peice f paper float on water while holding anitem withut sinking<p/>
<a href="./pp.pdf">PDF</a>
<p> 9/23/22 W finished our rube goldberg machine and it did'nt work as well as it should have. If we had more time and if my team didn't fool around as much we could have done better.

<p> 10/13/22 We made a paper airplane and threw it off a balcony,it was a good design BUT Abdul threw it into a tree accidentaly. <p>
<p> 10/20/22 For the past week we have been working on a bottle rocket. We thought of using a baloon but it would not expand in the bottle due to air-pressure<p>

<p> 10/21/22 We finally launched our bottle rocket and it did not go as expected. We loaded it with baking soda and vinegar adn when it launched it spun horizontly which caused vinger to spray everyone nearby, luckily Abdul and I watched from a distance so we were not sprayed by vinegar. The rocket did not go very high but it stayed in the air for around 5-6 seconds. <p>

<p> 11/8/22 For the past week we have been learning about breadboards and how they work. We made three on tinkercad but I couldn't upload the third one. This is my least favorite lesson so far, I am not good with this type of thing.

<p> 11/11/22  This whole week we worked on arduinos with partners,I didn't like this unit.
<p> 12/2/22 My team has been making bridges out of spaghetti and our first design kep falling apart and it took two to three days to finally finish putting it together.
A lot of our class' projects were destryoed aswell as our first design.
<p> 12/12/22 We have been making bridges and so far we have made three bridges in total and have only tested one, it failed<p>

<p> 12/15/22 We have our final bridge design but I dont think it will hold too much weight, it looks flimsy. If we had a few more noodles to use it would be much sturdier.<p>

<p> Our bridge broke as we were setting up the bucket because Nick did something, I don't  know what he did but we ended up testing whaever was left of our bridge and it was only a little over 1 pound. <p>
