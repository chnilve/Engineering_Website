<p> 9/6/22 For the past week we have been making a rube goldberg machine for a project</p>

<p> 9/7/22 We have started making a rube goldberg with groups<br>
<p> 9/16/22 Forthe past week we have been making a rube goldberg as a team and for challenge day we made a peice f paper float on water while holding anitem withut sinking<p/>
<a href="./pp.pdf">PDF</a>
<p> 9/23/22 W finished our rube goldberg machine and it did'nt work as well as it should have. If we had more time and if my team didn't fool around as much we could have done better.

<p> 10/13/22 We made a paper airplane and threw it off a balcony,it was a good design BUT Abdul threw it into a tree accidentaly. <p>
<p> 10/20/22 For the past week we have been working on a bottle rocket. We thought of using a baloon but it would not expand in the bottle due to air-pressure<p>

<p> 10/21/22 We finally launched our bottle rocket and it did not go as expected. We loaded it with baking soda and vinegar adn when it launched it spun horizontly which caused vinger to spray everyone nearby, luckily Abdul and I watched from a distance so we were not sprayed by vinegar. The rocket did not go very high but it stayed in the air for around 5-6 seconds. <p>

<p> 10/26/22 We made water filters out of two water bottles and a bunch of other materials, it was kind of simple and somewhat boring but still was cool.</p>

Today we played a game where we had to make highways and it would measure the effectivness, traffic flow and a bunch of other things. We competed with other groups in our class and we didn't claim any of the sectors for our team. This game was actually really hard and I thought it would be really simple.

<p> 11/8/22 For the past week we have been learning about breadboards and how they work. We made three on tinkercad but I couldn't upload the third one. This is my least favorite lesson so far, I am not good with this type of thing.

<p> 11/11/22  This whole week we worked on arduinos with partners,I didn't like this unit. It's kind of boring and I'm not interested in this type of stuff. I also don't understand it.<p/>

<p> 12/2/22 My team has been making bridges out of spaghetti and our first design kep falling apart and it took two to three days to finally finish putting it together.
A lot of our class' projects were destryoed aswell as our first design.
<p> 12/12/22 We have been making bridges and so far we have made three bridges in total and have only tested one, it failed<p>

<p> 12/15/22 We have our final bridge design but I dont think it will hold too much weight, it looks flimsy. If we had a few more noodles to use it would be much sturdier.<p>
<img src="final bridge" width = "300x" height ="400">
<p>Our bridge broke as we were setting up the bucket because Nick did something, I don't  know what he did but we ended up testing whaever was left of our bridge and it was only a little over 1 pound.</p>

     we were put into groups and was assigned to make a product and pitch it to the class like sharktank. Me, Chris and Yaghya thought of a heavy duty hand cleanser that could sanitize awell as moisturize hands. This product was made with car mechanics and constructon workers in mind, it is a sponge with soap inside of it that is activated by water and to make it along with labor cost it would only cost $6.03 and shipping would vary, it would be sold for $20 so we would make $13.97 profit. When we presented we realized we were'nt as prepared as the other groups because we forgot to make an offer slide, in the end we stil didn't get a deal.

<p> 1/27/23 On monday of this week our class finished presenting the sharktank presntations and we also made oobleck on wednesday. It was really messy and I got my phone dirty, when we started it turned really watery because Chris poured the whole cup of water even after I said not to. Although when we finished ours turned out to be the best. I took some home and threw it at my friend. Now on our challenge day we were given a deck of cards and which ever group had the highest stack of card won. I was grouped with Jason, Nicholas, and Chris. Our original plan was a simple card tower, after a few failed attempts on it we started turning the cards diagonally and that didn't work very well. I finally found an easy and effective solution to making the card tower sturdier and that was to double up the card so everything was reinforced and sturdier. It was working but we ran out of time. We didn't take any pictures though.</p>

<p> 2/3/23 This past week has been pretty crazy, it started off normal. On monday and tuesday Elio and I started using Tinker Cad to make our mouse trap car (we are almost finished with tinker cad). Now on wednessday we had a lock down, a homeless guy wandered in at around 8 in the morning and left thirty minutes later. Our security finally noticed a guy came in like 2 hours later after he left and we went into lockdown for another 2 hours. We were then evacuated to the church after the cops searched the campus and made sure it was safe. My only complaint was I didn't get lunch and I was extremely hungry afte. I feel like the situation could have been handled with more caution, the WHOLE school was led into an open church parking lot and if there really was an armed dude we would've been screwed. </p>

<p> 2/9/23 Today is challenge day and our challenge was to make something out of a yard stick, popsicle sticks, rubber bands, and tape and use it to deliver a water balloon safely a certain amount of distance. Our idea was to make a little box or something to hold our balloon. Our final design was a little three sided pyramid tht would lock our balloon inside. Then one of us held the stick and ran the distance required. We finished first.</p>

<p> 2/10/23 It is friday and it is update day. Our mouse trap car project is actually decent, we have finished building the frame and super gluing most of it. All we need now is the wooden rods for our wheels, aswell as string/rope then we are finished.</p>

<p> 2/17/23 we have been continuing to make our mouse trap car and we tested it already, it went pretty far and fast aswell. Now we just need to revise it and make some improvements to our car.</p>

<p>2/24/23 This whole week we have just been working on our mouse trap car project, we added car bourd discs between the wheels and the cardboard so the wheels would stop shifting to the side. This may have just made more traction for the car to roll but we will make it better somehow. We also changed the string to fishing line so it would be stronger. Now the only thing I think we should change is the stick because it is really flimsy and bends really easily. </p>

<p> 3/3/23 This week we worked more on the mouse trap car and the wheels were crooked and Elio and I were trying to fix it but it kept being weird and being crooked. Other than that, that was all we did to the mouse trap car. After, on the day we were going to test all of the mouse trap cars I wasn't At school and the wheel was still crooked and Elio was able to fix it before he tested it out and it worked, it got like third or second place and I am happy with that outcome. </p>

<p> 3/10/23 This week we have done various things. On monday we did the car analysis from our previous project, tuesday we did a career exploration for different types of engineering, wednesday we watched Mark Rober videos and finally thursday it was challenge day where we tried to make a boat out of certain materials to float acroos a gutter and we could blow on it twice per partner.</p>

<p> 3/24/23 Over spring break I did so many fun things with friends, we went to the americana and went shopping and we played hide n seek in a Macy's, and we all stayed up in facetime everynight playing games and screwing around, and we went to cv and found a shopping cart that we rode around and my friend brought it home. For the past week we have been working on a new project which requires us to drop an egg and make it safely hit the ground. So basically it's an eggdrop. We made a tinkercad and our plan is to use balloons as a cushion and cotton to protect the egg, while a trash bag acts as a parachute to slow down the egg.</p>
